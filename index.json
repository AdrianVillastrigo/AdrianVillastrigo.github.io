Both habitat types present differences based on their physical and chemical characteristics, leading to different ecological dynamics at geological scale, in essentially long-term habitat stability. Small standing water environments, where aquatic beetles are usually found, are usually filled up by sediments in decades, whilst running water environments are stable and they are connected with the drainage network, even when they sometimes dry up seasonally. Some studies had shown that one of the consequences of living in one kind or the other is a difference in range size linked to their dispersal capabilities, with standing water species having broader geographical ranges than running water species. It has been hypothesizing that dispersal abilities may affect gene flow and turnover, but there is a lack of knowledge of how these differences affect long-term diversification.\nHydroporini is a speciose tribe containing ca. 680 species living in both habitats, making them and ideal group to study diversification. We built a phylogeny of Hydroporini combining 5 genes obtained with sanger sequences plus 69 mitochondrial genomes. In total, 473 terminals representing species were used. Ecological data were obtained by bibliographic revision plus own collected information in the field. Phylogeny and habitat type evolution were reconstructed using Bayesian inference. Diversification rates were calculated using Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM) and method of moments (MM). Preliminary results suggest that the most recent common ancestor of Hydroporini was reconstructed with a preference for running water, with multiple shifts to standing waters. We also found several significant diversification shifts across the phylogeny, and a clear pattern of gradual accelerated speciation.","tags":[],"title":"Untangling extant biodiversity in Hydroporini","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo","A.","Jäch","M.

One of the most remarkable traits in primarily freshwater organisms is the possibility to tolerate saline or hypersaline habitats. Recent work in some water beetle families (Hydrophilidae and Dytiscidae) has led to the hypothesis that tolerance to salinity is an exaptation to drought resistance. However, whereas in Hydrophilidae there are fast and direct transitions from freshwater to hypersaline water, as expected under an exaptation scenario, in the studied Dytiscidae all transitions were gradual, from freshwater to saline and then hypersaline waters. In this work we study the third of the main lineages of water beetles with species in saline habitats, the genus Ochthebius (Hydraenidae). We build a comprehensive phylogeny of Ochthebius, with approximately 50% of the ca. 550 known species and a combination of three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes. Despite the general good support of most clades relationships among basal clades was still unresolved, so we obtained mitochondrial genomes of ca. 20 species with a mitochondrial metagenomics protocol with the aim to anchor some of the unsupported nodes in the tree. We compiled ecological data on the habitat of all species to reconstruct the tempo and mode of tolerance to salinity using Bayesian methods.","tags":[],"title":"Ochthebiini: a mitogenome approach to tempo and mode of salinity tolerance evolution","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo","A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533131809,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533131809,"objectID":"44d547f5a18bcc76e9c2f003fa2164bb","permalink":"/talk/australia-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:56:49+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/australia-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"From deserts to tropical forest - Short Stay","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo","A.","Andújar","C.","Arribas","P.","and Ribera","I."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516111007,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516111007,"objectID":"84422960a6195cbb5dabf9e573389ea9","permalink":"/talk/cisa-iv-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:56:47+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cisa-iv-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Phylogenetic trees are not always recovered with enough support to test particular hypothesis.

These traits may influence the origin and diversification of new lineages, and some of them may also facilitate the transition between different habitat types. Focusing on the aquatic environment, some of the most important transitions occurred between lotic and lentic environments, and between ecosystems with different salinities. With reference to the first transition, it has been established that species living in standing water (less persistent than running waters at geological time scales) need greater dispersion capability than running water species. On the second transition, some authors have shown that salinity tolerance may appear in independent lineages during arid periods, likely as a byproduct of increased resistance to desiccation. We use different groups of aquatic Coleoptera as evolutionary models: the genus Ochthebius (Hydraenidae), and tribes Hydroporini (Dytiscidae) and Hygrotini sensu lato (Dytiscidae). It is expected that transitions between habitat types had some effect on the diversification pattern on the lineages. We have tested these predictions with Hygrotini sensu stricto, including 129 specimens from 53 species with a Holartic and Afrotropical distribution. Five gene fragments were used in the phylogenetic analysis (COI, 16S, 18S, H3 and 28S). We used molecular phylogenies, ecological data and physiologic experiments to reconstruct macroevolutionary patterns of the traits using bayesian methods. Our results show a clear preference for lentic environments in Hygrotini, which are ancestral to the lineage, with repeated independent emergence of isolated lotic species. Similarly, high salinity tolerance has emerged independently in several lineages from an ancestor with slightly saline tolerance. Preliminary analyses suggest that the transitions to higher saline tolerance occurred predominantly in geological periods with increased aridity, supporting the hypothesis that salinity tolerance in water beetles could be an exaptation of tolerance to desiccation.","tags":[],"title":"Macroevolutionary consequences of habitat transitions in aquatic Coleoptera","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Villastrigo","A."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1445522190,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445522190,"objectID":"6a31e8ecc4c638c006ed67248e65dca5","permalink":"/talk/murcia-seminar-2015/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T15:56:30+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/murcia-seminar-2015/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Efectos ecológicos de la sequía sobre la comunidad de macroinvertebrados bentónicos en ecosistemas lacustres.
