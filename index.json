The species differs from the other two known species of Micragasma in both external and genital characters, but shares with them the presence of small setiferous tubercles on the surface of the head, pronotum and elytra, and a strong medial gibbosity on the head. In some characters, such as the structure and shape of the aedeagus, O. (M.) minoicus sp. n. is similar to other species of the genus Ochthebius, in particular of the subgenus Cobalius Rey, 1886, typical of coastal rockpools.","tags":["Coleoptera","Hydraenidae","Micragasma","new species","rockpools","Crete"],"title":"A new species of Micragasma J.
